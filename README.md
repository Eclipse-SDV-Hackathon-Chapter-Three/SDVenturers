Core idea: Mood detection and action

Driver mood detection, e.g. via bio signals such as heart rate, eye behavior.
Limit/adjust car/ecu behavior accordingly, e.g. limit maximum acceleration.


Developement process:

- Figure out mood detection. Facial recognition. AI?
- Data collection. Which sensors? Which signal? Algorithms?
- Scope of car/ecu behavior changes and implementation
- Testing via three simple scenarios (e.g. 3 face emotions)
- Communication/sharing via slack/whiteboard. Decisions via voting.
