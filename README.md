## Challenge

**SDV Lab**

### Core Idea: Mood Detection and Action

- Driver mood detection (e.g., via bio signals such as heart rate, eye behavior)
- Limit or adjust car/ECU behavior accordingly (e.g., limit maximum acceleration)

---

## Development Process

1. **Figure out mood detection:** Facial recognition, AI, etc.
2. **Data collection:**  
   - Which sensors?  
   - Which signals?  
   - Which algorithms?
3. **Scope of car/ECU behavior changes and implementation**
4. **Testing:**  
   - Via three simple scenarios (e.g., 3 face emotions)
5. **Communication/Sharing:**  
   - Via Slack/whiteboard  
   - Decisions made via voting
